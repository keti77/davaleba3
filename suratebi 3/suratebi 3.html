       <b> Lorem Ipsum</b> simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown<br> <i>printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining <br>essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the<u><mark> 1960s</mark></u> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software<br> like Aldus PageMaker including versions of </i><b>lorem Ipsum</b>.<br><br><b>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't <br>look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. “All the <br>Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet“. It uses a dictionary of over 200<br> Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.<i> The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free <br>from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</i></b>
